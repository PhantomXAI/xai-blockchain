**PhantomXAI** – The Privacy-First, AI-Powered, Post-Quantum Blockchain Infrastructure

---

## 🌐 Vision  
Build a secure, sovereign, and intelligent blockchain for the age of quantum computing and decentralized AI governance.

**XAI** is not just a blockchain. It is an **autonomous, AI-resilient mesh network** where privacy, fairness, and security meet across borders and devices.

# 🌐 XAI — Beyond Just a Digital Currency

**XAI is not just a cryptocurrency — it’s a fully decentralized, sovereign digital infrastructure.**

It combines:

- 🔁 A **mesh-based alternative internet**
- 💰 A **population-aware economic system**
- 🧠 **Biometric identity & KYC stored locally**
- 🗳️ **Offline-ready governance and voting**
- 🤖 **Edge AI infrastructure**
- 🔐 **Post-quantum secure communication**

> XAI is designed for resilience — in peace or crisis, online or offline.  
> It empowers people, not platforms.

## 🚀 Key Features

### 🔐 Post-Quantum Security  
- Utilizes **lattice-based cryptography** to resist future quantum computing threats.  
- Ensures long-term data protection and transaction integrity.

### 🧠 NeuroMesh Protocol  
- Hardware-level protocol enabling AI inference, encryption, and consensus on edge devices.  
- Supported devices: smartphones, routers, cameras, AI boxes, medical sensors.  
- All nodes are **continuously verified** for real activity (no fake/simulated devices).  
- Participants are rewarded in $XAI for contributing compute and verification power.

### 🪪 Local KYC & Biometric Verification  
- KYC documents (e.g., national ID, passport) are stored **locally** on user devices.  
- Encrypted using **zero-knowledge proofs** – no central authority holds the data.  
- Every transaction requires:
  - ✅ Face biometric verification  
  - ✅ Private key signature  
- Ensures regulatory compliance and protects user identity.

### 🗳️ Fair Global Governance  
- Initial token distribution is **population-based**, adjusted for economic disparity.  
- Citizens in each region vote on **government performance** using local governance modules.  
- If misuse is detected, **government access is frozen**, but **citizen access remains active**.  
- New representatives can be elected to restore node-level access.

### 📡 Mesh Architecture  
- Peer-to-peer design over WiFi, cellular, satellite, or offline mesh relays.  
- Ideal for regions with **low infrastructure or surveillance-heavy networks**.

### 💰 Tokenomics  
- **Initial token value**: `0 USD` (launch with no implicit financial promises).  
- **Total supply**: Determined and adjusted by community DAO proposals.  
- **Testnet contributors** will be rewarded on mainnet launch by address/password matching.  
- Smart contract rewards are dynamic and AI-assisted for fair emission and distribution.

### 🛡️ Anti-Fraud Intelligence  
- Network resists ghost nodes via:
  - Device fingerprinting  
  - Challenge-response checks  
  - Location + energy entropy validation  
- **No idle/simulated node** receives any form of compensation.
