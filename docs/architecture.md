## 🌐 1. Core Layers

### a. Blockchain Layer
- **Consensus:** AI-assisted Proof-of-Validation (PoV) + post-quantum cryptographic signatures
- **Ledger:** Immutable, scalable, sharded data with Merkle proofs
- **Pruning:** Adaptive storage pruning using a rotating node trust protocol

### b. NeuroMesh Layer
- **Devices:** Smartphones, routers, cameras, IoT, and AI units
- **Functions:** Biometric validation, AI inference, encrypted relaying, mesh bridging
- **Verification:** Periodic real-world activity checks (energy, location entropy)

### c. Governance Layer
- **Voting Protocol:** Citizens vote on local governance modules via zero-knowledge ballots
- **Access Control:** Node-level freezes for corrupt government entities
- **DAO:** Oversees upgrades, economic policy, and hardware incentive algorithms

## 🔐 2. Cryptographic Stack

- **Encryption:** Lattice-based post-quantum cryptography (NTRU or Kyber)
- **Proofs:** Zero-Knowledge Proofs (zk-SNARKs or zk-STARKs) for biometric/KYC validation
- **Identity:** Biometric-hardened keys locally generated per device

## 📡 3. Mesh Communication Protocol

- **Connectivity:** WiFi, 4G/5G, satellite, or offline P2P relays
- **Relay Mechanism:** Onion-routed encrypted packets across verified nodes
- **Redundancy:** Multi-path routing to ensure uptime in censored zones

## 🧠 4. AI-Driven Integrity

- **Ghost Node Prevention:** Pattern detection + challenge-response validation
- **Reward Fairness:** AI scoring adjusts token emission based on real contributions
- **Anomaly Alerts:** Automatic flagging of suspicious network behavior

---

## 🧪 5. Scalability & Fault Tolerance

- **Sharding:** Dynamic and region-based ledger partitioning
- **Fork Resistance:** Identity-bound consensus signatures reduce spam forks
- **Fallback Mode:** Offline device-to-device relay mode when internet fails
