# 🌐 Mesh Connectivity in XAI

## Overview
XAI's network leverages **mesh connectivity** to create a decentralized, resilient, and censorship-resistant communication layer between devices — even without the internet.

Initially, XAI will operate using the regular internet. As infrastructure improves, **XAI Boxes** will gradually replace centralized internet connections, forming a **fully decentralized alternative to traditional ISPs**.

## 🔁 P2P & Multi-Hop Connectivity

Each device acts as a **peer** and a **router**, creating a self-healing mesh that:

- Connects directly to nearby devices.
- Extends connectivity via **multi-hop relaying**.
- Automatically adapts to network changes or node failures.

## 🛰️ Hybrid Internet + Mesh Model

- **Early Phase:** Devices use regular internet for routing and sync.
- **Mature Phase:** Devices form a **pure mesh**, using:
  - **XAI Boxes** as core relays.
  - Satellite fallback (for remote areas).
  - AI-based optimization for route selection.

This allows XAI to function even during **internet outages**, natural disasters, or censorship attempts.

## 📶 OLSR Routing Protocol

- XAI uses **Optimized Link State Routing (OLSR)** for efficient data flow.
- Devices periodically broadcast their state, forming a real-time **routing map**.
- Typical mesh range: **up to 1–3 km per device**, extendable via relays.

## 🧠 AI-Powered Routing

- AI algorithms monitor:
  - Signal strength
  - Node reliability
  - Latency and congestion
- Optimal paths are dynamically selected to reduce delay and avoid weak nodes.

---

## 🧪 Example Use Cases

- **Disaster Zones:** Maintain communication when ISPs are down.
- **Rural Areas:** Extend connectivity where 4G/5G is unavailable.
- **Protest Regions:** Evade surveillance and network throttling.
- **Smart Cities:** Enable local peer-to-peer apps, payments, and identity.

## 💡 Why It Matters

> Centralized internet is a **single point of failure**.
>
> XAI Mesh builds the foundation for a **resilient, autonomous digital society**.
