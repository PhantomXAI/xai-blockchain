# 🪪 Local KYC & Identity Module

## 🧬 Purpose
Ensure users are verified without exposing their identity to central servers or third parties.

---

## 🔐 Local Verification Model

- KYC documents (ID, Passport) stored **encrypted** locally.
- Data protected using **Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs)**.
- Biometric authentication (face recognition) is required for any critical action.

---

## ✅ Transaction Requirements

- Local face scan
- Matching of private key
- Real-time device verification (via NeuroMesh)

All three must succeed for a transaction to proceed.

---

## 🧠 Privacy-First Design

- No biometric or document data is ever uploaded.
- ZKPs allow the network to confirm identity **without revealing any personal info**.
- KYC revocation keys are split across AI-governed shards for protection.

---

## 🔄 Device Migration

When a user wants to switch to a new device:
1. Original device must initiate **device transfer mode**.
2. Both devices must be physically close and verified via mesh.
3. Transfer is encrypted, signed, and requires biometric confirmation on both ends.

---

## 🔒 Government Freeze Logic

If a government account is frozen due to misuse:
- Citizen identities and access remain **intact**.
- Citizens can elect new representatives via on-device voting.
- No citizen is punished for system misuse by higher authorities.

> Identity is sovereign. KYC should protect people — not control them.
