# 🪪 XAI KYC & Biometric Protocol

The KYC & Biometric verification system in XAI NeuroMesh ensures strong regulatory compliance **without compromising user privacy**.

---

## 🔐 Local KYC Vault

- Users upload official documents (e.g., national ID, passport) directly to their **own device**.
- Documents are **encrypted locally** using:
  - Device-specific key pairs
  - Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs)
  - Biometric hash (e.g., face vector) as salt
- No document ever leaves the device or gets stored on any centralized server or cloud node.

## 🧠 Dual Authentication: Biometric + Private Key

For every transaction or critical action on the blockchain, users must pass **two layers of authentication**:

1. ✅ **Face Biometric Verification**
   - Real-time face scan (liveness detection + face match).
   - Matches against locally stored face vector.

2. ✅ **Private Key Signature**
   - Transaction signed using the user’s private wallet key.

**Both steps are mandatory** to confirm user identity and authorization.

## 📦 Zero-Knowledge Proof Mechanism

- ZKPs are used to **prove KYC validity** (e.g., user is over 18, valid citizen) without revealing the actual document.
- KYC status (verified/unverified) is broadcast to the mesh network via ZKP validation hash only.

Example:
```json
{
  "kyc_status": "verified",
  "zkp_hash": "0xFA33A7D…",
  "face_verified": true
}
⚠️ Revocation & Expiry
Users can revoke or update their KYC data locally at any time.

Devices check for document expiry via local logic.

Expired credentials disable transaction ability until re-verified.

🛡️ Anti-Fraud Protections
Spoofed faces, static photos, and replay attacks are rejected using:

Liveness detection

3D face scan validation

Challenge-response audio cues

If biometric mismatch is detected:

Transaction is aborted

Device is temporarily flagged and rate-limited on the mesh

🔄 Cross-Device Sync (Optional)
For users with multiple devices:

Encrypted KYC vault can be synced between personal devices using XAI's mesh relay protocol.

Requires biometric and key confirmation on both ends.

🔚 Privacy First
No centralized KYC authority

No cloud upload

No metadata tracking

All processing done on edge devices

Open-source cryptography libraries are used to ensure full transparency

Your identity is yours. XAI ensures it stays that way
