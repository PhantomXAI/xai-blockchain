# 🧩 Node Types in XAI Network

## Overview
The XAI Network includes multiple node types, each playing a unique role in maintaining decentralization, performance, and security.

---

## 🧠 Full Nodes (XAI Boxes)
- **Primary backbone** of the network.
- Equipped with high compute, storage, and connectivity.
- Handle:
  - Block validation
  - Smart contract execution
  - Mesh routing and relay
  - Local KYC and biometric functions
- Often located in homes, public hubs, or private facilities.

---

## 📱 Lightweight Devices
- Smartphones, tablets, and small IoT devices.
- Limited validation role but can:
  - Participate in voting
  - Run basic mesh communications
  - Perform KYC for their user
- Rely on full nodes for syncing and block retrieval.

---

## 🌐 Gateway Relays
- Devices that bridge XAI Mesh to traditional internet (during early stages).
- Support the **gradual migration** from centralized internet.
- Traffic shaping, NAT traversal, and bandwidth load-balancing.

---

## 👁️ Watchdog Validators
- Randomly selected for temporary oversight roles.
- Monitor:
  - Ghost node behavior
  - Reward manipulation
  - Inactive or spoofed devices
- AI-assisted, transparent auditing.

---

## 📡 Mesh-Only Relays
- Devices (often embedded or mobile) with no internet access.
- Rely entirely on local mesh links.
- Useful in offline zones or disaster recovery.

> ⚙️ Diversity in node types ensures **scalability, resilience, and inclusivity** across all environments.
