# 💰 Tokenomics of XAI

## Overview  
XAI is built with a **utility-first, fairness-aware** tokenomics system. The token is not just a reward—it's a representation of trust, contribution, and access across the NeuroMesh.

---

## 🌀 Token Purpose

- **Transaction Fees**: Gas for secure and verified actions.
- **Device Rewards**: Compensation for nodes contributing compute, storage, or validation.
- **Governance Rights**: Voting power for protocol and regional decisions.
- **Access Tiers**: Some network features may require token staking or holding.

---

## 🌍 Fair Distribution Model

- **Initial Supply**: Pre-minted based on global population and equity index.
- **Per-Country Allocation**:
  -  supply allocated based on population
  - Adjusted for GDP per capita (fairness correction)
- **No private pre-sales** or VC allocations to avoid early centralization.

---

## 🏗️ Earning Mechanisms

- **Proof of Contribution**:
  - Running a node (compute/storage)
  - Participating in consensus
  - Providing bandwidth via satellite or relay devices
- **Community Bounties**: Development, design, education
- **Governance Participation**: Voter rewards to incentivize DAO involvement
