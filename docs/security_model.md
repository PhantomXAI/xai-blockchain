# 🛡️ XAI Security Model

## Overview
XAI NeuroMesh is designed to operate securely in a post-quantum world, with a layered security model spanning from cryptography to physical hardware.

---

## 🔐 Post-Quantum Cryptography

- Utilizes **lattice-based encryption schemes** (e.g., NTRU, Kyber).
- All signatures and key exchanges are quantum-resilient.
- Keys are periodically rotated and audited via on-chain attestations.

---

## 📍 Node Verification & Ghost Node Protection

To prevent fake/simulated nodes:

- **Device fingerprinting:** Unique signatures based on hardware behavior.
- **Challenge-response:** Random, real-time validation tasks.
- **Energy & entropy checks:** Real activity vs. simulation.

No compensation is given to idle or inactive nodes.

---

## 🧠 AI-Based Threat Detection

- On-device AI models monitor:
  - Unusual transaction behavior
  - Sudden IP/hardware changes
  - Malicious mesh activity (relay poisoning, Sybil attacks)

If detected:
- Node is temporarily quarantined.
- Human-AI audit team can review behavior on-chain.

---

## 🧬 Identity Protection

- Biometric + local key verification for all critical operations.
- No identity leaves the device:
  - Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) validate KYC ownership.
  - No third-party can intercept or store biometric data.

---

## 🛰️ Communication Security

- Mesh traffic is:
  - End-to-end encrypted (AES-256 + PQC layer)
  - Obfuscated using traffic-shaping AI for metadata privacy
  - Validated across multiple independent paths

---

## 🔒 Redundancy & Fail-Safe Logic

- Critical system states are:
  - Sharded and distributed over AI-trusted devices.
  - Regularly verified for consistency.
  - Resistant to single-point-of-failure or targeted shutdowns.
