# 💰 Rewards & Incentives System in XAI

## Overview

XAI employs a dynamic, merit-based incentive system that rewards real contribution, promotes network security, and discourages dishonest behavior.

---

## 🧩 Reward Categories

Nodes and users are rewarded based on their roles and verified actions:

- **Compute Contribution**  
  Devices that perform cryptographic tasks, AI verification, or mesh routing.

- **Storage Providers**  
  Devices that offer persistent, encrypted storage for pruning history and sharded backups.

- **Security Validators**  
  Devices that participate in anomaly detection, behavioral analysis, and threat response.

- **Data Relays**  
  Nodes that provide high-bandwidth, stable mesh relay services to underserved regions.

- **Human Auditors**  
  Verified users that review flagged activity and contribute to governance or dispute resolution.

## 📊 Merit-Based Distribution

- **Proof-of-Value** > Proof-of-Work  
  Rewards are calculated based on the **utility** and **authenticity** of contribution, not just computational effort.

- **Dynamic Scoring System**  
  Each node is evaluated using:
  - Real-time performance metrics
  - AI-based trust scoring
  - Community feedback and on-chain history

---

## 🚫 Dishonesty & Penalties

- **Ghost Nodes / Simulated Activity**  
  - No reward issued.
  - Repeated offenses → node banned.

- **Byzantine Behavior**  
  (e.g. falsified responses, protocol tampering)  
  - Immediate quarantine + public record log.
  - Penalization through slashing future earnings.

---

## 🎯 Fairness Mechanisms

- **Location & Resource Awareness**  
  Nodes from regions with limited infrastructure receive **boosted baseline rewards**.

- **Device Diversity Bonus**  
  Incentives increase when diverse hardware types join (phones, sensors, cameras...).

- **Newcomer Protection**  
  Newly added nodes are given grace period with protected reward floor to ramp up participation.

## 🛠️ Reward Claiming & Usage

- All rewards are issued in **XAI Tokens**.
- Tokens can be:
  - Used for governance voting
  - Redeemed for digital services
  - Staked for influence and upgrades
  - Exchanged for assets
