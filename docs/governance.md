# 🗳️ Governance in XAI NeuroMesh

## Overview
XAI introduces a **decentralized, region-aware governance system** designed to balance fairness, autonomy, and accountability across all participating populations.

---

## 🌍 Population-Based Token Allocation

- Initial token distribution is calculated based on:
  - **Total population** per country or region.
  - **Economic disparity adjustment factor** to ensure fair opportunities.
- This approach prevents early centralization and encourages broader adoption.

---

## 🧠 Localized Voting Mechanism

- Each country or region has a **local governance module**.
- Citizens vote on:
  - Government performance.
  - Community proposals.
  - Representative rotation and access rights.
- Voting is **private and secured** via:
  - Face biometrics
  - Zero-Knowledge Proofs
  - Local-device key signatures

---

## ❄️ Government Access Suspension Protocol

- If abuse, fraud, or manipulation is detected:
  - **Government node access is suspended.**
  - **Citizen access remains fully active.**
- Local citizens can:
  - Nominate a new representative.
  - Restore node-level access through democratic consensus.

---

## 🧩 DAO-Like Evolution

- Over time, global governance evolves into a **layered DAO system**:
  - Local DAOs (per country/region)
  - Continental/interregional DAOs
  - Core protocol DAO (for global consensus updates)

---

## 📜 Governance Upgrade Proposals

- Major changes to protocol, tokenomics, or rules must:
  - Be proposed publicly on-chain.
  - Pass a **multi-layered approval** (local → regional → global).
  - Undergo a **7-day review period** and **72-hour final vote**.

---

## 🛡️ Anti-Centralization Measures

- No entity (even core developers) can:
  - Unilaterally change protocol rules.
  - Override local or global vote outcomes.
- Multi-signature, threshold-based protections are built into all governance layers.

> 🔐 True decentralization means **trust in the people**, not the platform.
